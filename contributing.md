## Branch Strategy

We use a **Git Flow** inspired branching model optimized for continuous integration:

### Branch Types

#### `main` Branch
- **Purpose**: Production-ready code
- **Protection**: Protected branch, requires PR approval
- **Deployment**: Auto-deploys to production environment

#### `develop` Branch
- **Purpose**: Integration branch for features
- **Protection**: Protected branch, requires PR approval
- **Deployment**: Auto-deploys to staging environment

#### Feature Branches: `feat/feature-name`
- **Purpose**: New features and enhancements
- **Naming**: `feat/eco-badges`, `feat/vendor-dashboard`
- **Base**: Created from `develop`
- **Merge**: Back to `develop` via PR

#### Bugfix Branches: `fix/issue-description`
- **Purpose**: Bug fixes for non-critical issues
- **Naming**: `fix/cart-calculation-error`
- **Base**: Created from `develop`
- **Merge**: Back to `develop` via PR

#### Hotfix Branches: `hotfix/critical-issue`
- **Purpose**: Critical production fixes
- **Naming**: `hotfix/security-vulnerability`
- **Base**: Created from `main`
- **Merge**: To both `main` and `develop` via PR

### Branch Naming Conventions

```bash
